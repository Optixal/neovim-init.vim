# Optixal's Neovim init.vim

Use it as a regular text editor, with [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/vim) as the main colorscheme, key information from [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline), and subtle git diff information with [vim-signify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-signify):

Or use it as a full-fledged IDE, with autocompletion from [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), a filesystem explorer from [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree), and a side window from [Tagbar](https://github.com/preservim/tagbar) to browse tags and view the structure of the file you are working on:

Quickly find files or strings by fuzzy searching with [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) in a beautiful pop-up window:

Or perhaps.. ~~procrastinate~~ multitask with [vim-hackernews](https://github.com/dansomething/vim-hackernews) at the side while coding:

Transparent/translucent terminal background support (uncomment `autocmd ColorScheme * call TransparentBackground()`), example from WSL2 running Ubuntu on Windows:

## Installing and Updating

### Install

#### Automated Installation

`./install.sh`

Automatically installs my configuration, along with dependencies into your system. Tested on Ubuntu 20.04. I highly suggest reading and understanding each line of the installation script before running it, especially if you are using other Linux distros, or macOS. For macOS, manually run the commands, and use `homebrew` instead of `apt`.

#### Post Installation

##### Download and install a Nerd Font

Airline and devicons require a patched font, or Nerd Font in order to display properly. Run `./font_install.sh` to download and install Iosevka Term Nerd Font into your `~/.fonts` directory, or run the command manually:

```sh
curl -fLo ~/.fonts/Iosevka\ Term\ Nerd\ Font\ Complete.ttf --create-dirs https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/master/patched-fonts/Iosevka/Regular/complete/Iosevka%20Term%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf
```

Once downloaded, open your terminal's preferences and change the font to "Iosevka Term Regular". If the font is not there, your OS' font directory may not be `~/.fonts`. Find out which directory your fonts are stored in, and place the downloaded font file in that directory instead.

##### Install coc extensions

To get autocompletion capabilities for the various languages you work with, you need to install coc extensions for coc. If you code in JS, do frontend, and write Python, run the following within nvim:

```
:CocInstall -sync coc-tsserver coc-json coc-html coc-css coc-pyright
```

Find out more about coc extensions and what is available over [here](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions).

##### Alias vim

It may be easier for you to type `vim` instead of `nvim` everytime you edit a file, so aliasing it could save you some trouble. Add an alias to your bashrc/zshrc/somerc or aliases file to alias nvim to vim:

```sh
echo "alias vim='nvim'" >> ~/.bashrc
```

##### Fix nvim + tmux issues

Running nvim within a tmux session may cause certain unwanted issues like escape key lag, or displaying wrong colors. Run `cat .tmux.conf >> ~/.tmux.conf` or manually add these to your `~/.tmux.conf` configuration file to address the issues:

```sh
set -sg escape-time 5 # fix vim esc delay
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color" # ensures vim uses right $TERM color, default is "screen"
set -ga terminal-overrides ",*256col*:Tc" # fixes vim reproducing slightly wrong colors in tmux
```

### Update

#### Updates from me

I occasionally update and push my new configurations here. If you want to receive the updates, you can pull the latest init.vim and replace the one you have.

```sh
git pull
cp init.vim ~/.config/nvim/
```

#### vim-plug commands for plugins

Run these to install new plugins, update or delete existing plugins, or upgrade vim-plug itself.

* Install plugins: `:PlugInstall` in nvim
* Update plugins: `:PlugUpdate` in nvim
* Delete unused plugins: `:PlugClean` in nvim
* Update vim-plug itself: `:PlugUpgrade` in nvim
